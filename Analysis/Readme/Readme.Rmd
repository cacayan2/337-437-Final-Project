Please read this Readme file in its knitted version, either `Readme.pdf` or `Readme.html`!

This subsection of the repository does not contain any content that will be directly part of the final submission, but is a place for everyone to play with ideas in before finalizing and inserting the analyses into the report. 

There is no structure for this directory, feel free to just add files as you feel necessary!
